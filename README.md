# JustDoIt

## About 
Our third project during the FAC skills bootcamp was to create a simple checklist/to do list. The goal of this project is to use our learnings on TDD (test driven development), advanced CSS and advanced DOM to create a dynamic way of sorting through a checklist. 
<br>
We started off by writing the tests first to help inform what functions to build and how to build them. So, before moving forward we wrote 4 tests, 2 each.

## Project Brief & User Stories 

As a user I want to: 
- Add tasks to a list so that I can keep track of them
- Check things off my list so that I can see what I’ve done
- Delete things from the list if I don’t need to do them anymore
- Use all the features of the app without a mouse
- Filter out completed to-dos from my list so that I can focus on what’s left to do


## Learnings
### Testing 
- [ ] Check that passing a given input into our tests returns the expected output
- [ ] Write tests to mimic the behaviour of a user performing different actions

We used TDD but then when refactoring the code, we didn't go back to rewrite the tets.

### JS 
- [x] Write testable, modular functions
- [x] Write functions that add, remove or modify DOM nodes
- [x] Apply event listeners to HTML form elements
- [x] Use scope to control what variables are accessible inside functions and blocks

### Design 
- [x] Use CSS grid to create complex layouts
- [x] Use CSS grid to make layouts that adapt to the viewport size

## Accessing the project

You can clone into JustDoIt in your text editor with the below terminal prompt:

```
git clone https://github.com/fac27/JustDoIt
```

From there, you can access and open the index.html file within your browser.

We removed the promises as they were redundant but haven't merged yet - they're in the branch remove-promises.
